OpenFriends
===========

OpenFriends is about more than just your contacts: it's about a
distributed social layer for the web. Add your friends once, and take
them with you, everywhere you go.

About OpenFriends
-----------------

When you join a social network community site, you have to start adding
your list of friends one by one. Either that, or you have to grant them
access to your email account. In the end, it is either a real pain or a
dangerous privacy violation. Besides, doing the same thing over and over
for each new social website has turned the experience into a constant
hassle.

OpenFriends solves this problem by providing a way for you to share
your list of friends that respects your privacy.

Some solutions
--------------

Right now there is one way of easing the pain: microformats. You can
have an hCard in some website, along with a list of contacts in XFN
format, and point to that URL when signing up to that new social network
website. There are many sites that already provide hCards and XFN lists
for you, like Twitter and Flickr, and there are also some sites that are
ready to consume that information. What is the problem then?

XFN and hCard limitations
-------------------------

Even though both XFN and hCard are standardized, each provider exposes
the set of contact data of its preference. Besides, as the profile and
the list of contacts are publicly accessible via web, there are a lot
of privacy issues at stake. In the end, the XFN list shows only a list
of related usernames within that website, and it is usually not enough
information for recreating your network of friends somewhere else.
